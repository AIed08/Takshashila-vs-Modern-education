            <h2 id="overview">Takshashila University: A Brief Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Takshashila (Taxila) University</strong> was one of the oldest and most renowned centers of learning in ancient India, believed to have been established around the 5th century BCE. It was located in what is now Pakistan.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academic Prestige:</strong> Takshashila attracted students from across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. It was a hub for higher education and specialized in a wide range of subjects including the Vedas, grammar, philosophy, astronomy, medicine, politics, warfare, music, and commerce.</li>
                <li><strong>Renowned Scholars:</strong> Some of the most famous scholars associated with Takshashila include Panini, the grammarian who composed the Ashtadhyayi; Chanakya (Kautilya), the author of Arthashastra; and Jivaka, a physician in the court of King Bimbisara.</li>
                <li><strong>Admission and Curriculum:</strong> There was no formal structure for admission, and students of all ages came to study under gurus (teachers) who were masters of their respective subjects. Education was highly personalized and students often lived with their teachers.</li>
                <li><strong>Duration and Fees:</strong> The duration of studies varied depending on the subject and the student's capacity to learn. Education was not free, and students paid fees in the form of donations or services to their teachers.</li>
                <li><strong>Teaching Methods:</strong> The methods of instruction were primarily oral, with a strong emphasis on debate, discussion, and direct transmission of knowledge from teacher to student.</li>
            </ul>
